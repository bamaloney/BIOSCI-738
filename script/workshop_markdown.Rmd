## Note to self:
> To "grade" your work I will clone your repo and expect to be able to knit your .Rmd file as it sits within your project; make sure you've pushed everything so that I can do this. Remember, this means pushing the .Rmd file and all things it relies on (e.g., data, extra scripts) NOT the .html file you knit it to.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
```

Start with tidyverse
```{r tidyverse, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```
Note that the `message = FALSE` parameter stops messages from `R` appearing in our document. 
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

necessary packages
```{r packages, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#install packages if necessary, then load to library
library(predictmeans)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
```


#Workshop 3 
##submission instructions
>Now you have your repo set up I would like you to build on the plots you created last week and fit one or two linear models to the data, or equivalent if not possible. These are not binding, just an exploratory analysis. Based on the outputs draw inference as you see fit.

This week in lecture, we discussed how we can adjust our models when conducting multiple comparisons 
Let's first go back to our simple rat data from last week.
```{r adjusting for multiple comparisons}
#refresh the memory with data and model
rats <- read.csv("~/Documents/data/BIOSCI-738/data/rats_crd_AUC.csv")
## need to have surgery as a factor
rats$Surgery <- as.factor(rats$Surgery)
## calculate mean response by treatment group
rats %>%  group_by(Surgery) %>%  summarise(avg_logAUC = mean(logAUC), avg_AUC = mean(AUC))
rats_lm <- lm(logAUC ~ Surgery, data = rats)
```

```{r multiple comparisons tests}
## Bonferroni vs Tukey

# Tukey
tukey <- predictmeans(rats_lm , modelterm = "Surgery", adj = "tukey", pairwise = TRUE)
tukey
# bonferrnoi
bonferroni <- predictmeans(rats_lm , modelterm = "Surgery", adj = "bonferroni", pairwise = TRUE)
bonferroni
# Tukey's HSD
TukeyHSD(aov(logAUC~Surgery, data = rats))

```
One isn't necessarily better than the other, they all generally give the dame results. The important part is that you are wise enough to control the risk of testing multiple variables.

Now let's look at a more complex data set, still looking at rats.
```{r }
rcbd <- read_csv("~/Documents/data/BIOSCI-738/data/rcbd.csv")
rcbd$Run <- as.factor(rcbd$Run)
rcbd$Rat <- as.factor(rcbd$Rat)
head(rcbd)

dis_organ <- read_csv("~/Documents/data/BIOSCI-738/data/factorial_expt.csv")
head(dis_organ)
```

# Workshop 2
#submission instructions
>Now you have your R project set up I would like you to produce an informative plot (or plots) and a write a brief summary section explaining your data (or the dataset provided). You must write up your anlysis in the .Rmd file (edit/add to as necessary) ... You should ensure that this "knits" (to .html) as you'd expect; always a good check to do this a few times when writing up.

This week, we discussed the basics of multivariate analysis using the commands lm() and anova().
There are a variety of graphical options that display the full range of data more accurately than a basic bar plot.

load data
```{r very exciting data}
rats <- read.csv("~/Documents/data/BIOSCI-738/data/rats_crd_AUC.csv")
glimpse(rats)

```


```{r summarizing treatment group response, echo=FALSE}
## calculate mean response by treatment group
rats %>%  group_by(Surgery) %>%  summarise(avg = mean(logAUC))

```

```{r linear model}
## fit a linear model
rats_lm <- lm(logAUC ~ Surgery, data = rats)
#print results
rats_lm

```

```{r anova}
## carry out "one-way ANOVA"
rats_aov <- aov(logAUC ~ Surgery, data = rats)
## print results (F-table)
rats_aov
```

### both methods provide the same results

# what about pairwise comparisons?
```{r summary}
## print out estimated coefficients & associated STDs and hypothesis results
summary(rats_lm)$coef

```

```{r editing data, echo=FALSE}
## need to have surgery as a factor
rats$Surgery <- as.factor(rats$Surgery)
## calculate mean response by treatment group
rats %>%  group_by(Surgery) %>%  summarise(avg_logAUC = mean(logAUC), avg_AUC = mean(AUC))
rats_lm <- lm(logAUC ~ Surgery, data = rats)
```

```{r pairwise}
####**** Using predictmeans****####
library(predictmeans)
## print out to console (by default also produces plot)
predictmeans(rats_lm, modelterm = "Surgery",  pairwise = TRUE)
```

Transforming our raw data with a log transformation
```{r comparing raw and transformed data}
###*** Raw vs log AUC***###
raw <- ggplot(data = rats, aes(x = Surgery, y = AUC)) +  geom_violin()
log <- ggplot(data = rats, aes(x = Surgery, y = logAUC)) +  geom_violin()

library(patchwork) ## nice package for combining ggplots
raw | log ## see the difference!

## fit a model to the raw data
rats_lm_raw <- lm(AUC ~ Surgery, data = rats)
anova(rats_lm_raw)
```


```{r model diagnostic raw vs transformed data, echo=FALSE}
## will need to install the gglm package first
gglm::gglm(rats_lm_raw) | gglm::gglm(rats_lm)
```
Here we compare how log transforming our data fixes the fit of our residuals vs. fitted and normal Q-Q plots.


```{r additional graphs}
ggplot(data=rats, aes(Surgery, logAUC)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = rats, aes(x = Surgery, y = logAUC)) +  
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x="Surgery", y="logAUC", title="Transformed AUC Values Across Surgery Type")
```


# Workshop 1: Messy Data
>DNA markers
Data from [Identification and evaluation of age-correlated DNA methylation markers for forensic use](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872497316300461?casa_token=qPk_jTQ4H5EAAAAA:Tu4wBtVyHzRAsB_7k3uIXsTqcsVucoVi7AvN54Evrue-Bw8CmK6CHraK0mjS-G4O7XF50V_cAI0)

Read in the genomics data, remember this is set as a `.Rproj` so the path is **relative**

```{r genomics}
genomics <- read.csv("~/Documents/data/BIOSCI-738/data/dna_markers.csv")
glimpse(genomics)

```

# Intro to R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r name}
my_name <- "Bri"
my_name
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r rnorm, echo=FALSE}
plot(rnorm(1:1000))
```
