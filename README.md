## Template repository (repo) for GitHub Classrooms BIOSCI738 workshops

Well done you got this far!

This template repo is set up as a basic [RStudio Project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects). It contains the basics for you to get started on the analysis of the included dataset (in the `data` folder); you are stronly encouraged to upload your own though. Head to the `script` folder and find the `.Rmd` file that has the basics for writing a document in [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 

Each week you'll be expected to write-up some analysis/manipulation of the data (based on what we've covered in the lectures) using plots, code-chunks, and whatever else you fancy. Remember it should be easy to follow and informative! You are then expected to **push** your changes for grading (due midday the Wednesday following the workshop).
